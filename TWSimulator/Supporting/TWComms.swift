 Controls the communications for checking the user login information.
 
 This `struct` controls the communications between the local app and the servrs, if present.
 
 - Note: The initial implementation only checks the login for a single local user.  In the future, this is where the RESTful API calls will be completed.

     This function process the login request for a specific user.

     If the login information is not correct, the return is `nil` and the appropriate error is thrown.
     
     If the correct user information is provided, the `TWUser` object is saved to the keychain.  Saving the object to the keychain provides a secure and easy method to pull current user information.
     
     - Parameter username: The username to login.

     - Throws: `UserError.UsernameOrPasswordIncorrect` The error is thrown if the username does not exist or the username does not authenticate with the password supplied
     
     - Returns: `TWUser` *or* `nil`.
